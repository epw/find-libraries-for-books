      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
	The source code for this site is at <a href="https://github.com/epw/find-libraries-for-books">https://github.com/epw/find-libraries-for-books</a>.

      <p>
	This site just barely does the minimum the author requires of
	it. There are a lot of improvements that will hopefully be
	added if the author has time, such as selection of which
	Overdrive and Hoopla library networks to query, and links to
	the particular book records when they are found.
