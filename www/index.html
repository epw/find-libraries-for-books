          This website allows you to check one or more books against
          several library networks' ebook lending. It only tells you
          about books from your list that you could borrow
          immediately, with no wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem it is trying to solve is that if you have a
          number of books you want to read, and you don't care which
          one you read next, but you want to start reading right
          now, then you're out of luck. You have to check each book
          against each possible library in turn, until you find one
          (or give up and buy one online, which is almost always
          easy and available, but costs money instead of making use
          of your library).
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the books you're looking for here. One per line, with
          the title, a comma, and the author's first and last
          names. If there are commas in the title, then wrap the
          title in quotation marks. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus", Mary
            Shelley</li>
        </ul>
        Using just a part of the title or author's name may work
        (such as just their last name), however, it increases the
        chance that the system will misidentify the book and so
        say the wrong one is present.

      This site just barely does the minimum the author requires of
      it. There are a lot of improvements that will hopefully be
      added if the author has time, such as selection of which
      Overdrive and Hoopla library networks to query, and links to
      the particular book records when they are found.
