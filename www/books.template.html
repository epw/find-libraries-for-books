      In the Overdrive column, you will be told the network that has
      the book available. Checking out on Overdrive will also check

      In the Hoopla column, you will be told if the book was found (in
      the Somerville Public Library's account).

    <p>
      The Other column indicates if the book was found in <a href="https://openlibrary.org">Open Library</a> (currently unavailable) or <a
        href="https://gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>.
